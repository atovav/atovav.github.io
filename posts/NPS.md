Monthly NPS
================

<p>The following is a brief analysis of a Monthly NPS presentation. The company and slides are omitted, and the values are modified for confidentiality.<br />
The first thing was to graph the NPS and the total number of responses over time. All the graphs were made in tableau for dashboard purposes and then send as image to a presentation.</p>

We see that the NPS is largely stable, in November we recovered from the problems in October.
