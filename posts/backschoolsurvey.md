Back to school store survey
================
Alan<br />
2021<br />

<p>The data that we had was about a survey they did for a back-to-school promotion. <br />
The survey results where summarized and classified into 2: Our stores and all stores. <br />
We created the following graph with the information provided.</p>

<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">

</div>

<p>The graph we preferred was a bar graph with the difference between our store and our competitors. A positive score means that we are doing better than the competitors and a negative score means that we are doing worse.</p>
<br />
<p>We added some insights and recommendations to the graph. And opted in colors that highlight the good, the key issues and the bad.</p>
