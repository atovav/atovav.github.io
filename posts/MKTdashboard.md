Simple Marketing Dashboard
================
Alan<br />

<p>The following is a concept for a simple marketing dashboard. This dashboard was made in Tableau, still a work in progress.</p>

<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Dashboard.jpg" alt style>
</div>

<p>The idea for this dashboard is to only use BANs. <br />
BANs mean Big Aggregated Numbers and are useful for summarizing data. They work as important KPIs figures. <br />
The dashboard can accommodate 3 rows and 3 columns of BANs.<br />
Each KPI consist of the following:<br />
<br />
•	Title<br />
•	Current year number<br />
•	% Change vs previous year, using arrows to denote trend. <br />
•	Monthly line for the current year, with labels at the beginning of the year and the end of the year.<br /> 
<br />
Other ideas: change in design, add a previous year with less contrast. <br />
I will be updating this page with those ideas. </p>
